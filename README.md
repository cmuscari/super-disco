# Super Disco

## Description
This application is a work day scheduler tool for employees to use.  It lists the work day out in blocks of one-hour increments.  Each hour block contains it's own text area to write tasks and reminders to, as well as it's own save button.  The save button only saves the text that was written in it's corresponding text area.  Upon clicking these save buttons, the application tells the browser to save the text content to local storage, where it can also be retrieved from upon reloading the page.
